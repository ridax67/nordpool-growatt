# nordpool-growatt
A Nordpool chart and table for growatt inverters with solax modbus hacs integration.  In addition to a chart (copied from ha forum) it will show a price table with grid/battery periods colored 

The Nordpool chart requires the core Nordpool integration and Apexcharts. 
The chart is taken completely from Home Assistant forum from a member
Teebar I think, from this link

The table is almost all up to chatgpt. It uses the prefix growatt_inverter
for its entities. If you use something else search and replace. 

I know the html has some syntax errors, but it works (double ending
font tags). I didn't know how to avoid them and thought one extra is
better than one missing. Chatgpt didn't know either, except for
km lengths of code that eventually maybe could have worked.
